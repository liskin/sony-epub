PDFCrop Changelog and Known Issues
==================================

Changelog
=========

17 February 2009 -- version 0.2

Mark Sherry brought this project back to life and made substantial improvements. He rewrote the script in Python, included support for command line options, included a check for the necessary commands and enabled support for PDF files that are over 10,000 pages long. 


29 November 2007 -- version 0.1 

Eric Doviak wrote a Bash script that called mawk, ps2pdf, pdf2ps, poster and pdftk. 


Known Issues 
============

The output file that PDFCrop produces is (almost always) larger than the original PDF file. The file size increase occurs when PDFCrop calls poster to resize the PS page. That size increase does not disappear when the PS page is converted back to PDF. I've tried passing distiller parameters to ps2pdf, but none of the parameters that I tried reduce the size of the outputted PDF file.

Licensing and "extra usage" information is not printed when the -l and -a options are passed.

Eric Doviak doesn't know Python at all. He's an archaic fool who prefers Perl. Continued development of this project will require Eric to either learn Python or rewrite the script in Perl. 

Eric should also consider passing this project on to someone with more time to devote to it.
